Now we only have a very stupid html snake game, have fun!

#### Snakes

| #Player |        Control        |
| :-----: | :-------------------: |
|    0    | up, left, down, right |
|    1    |      W, A, S, D       |
|    2    |      I, J, K, L       |
|    3    |      T, F, G, H       |

|          Item          |                            Effect                            |
| :--------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|       red block        |                     lengthen your snake                      |
| blinking magenta block |     enhance the effect of each red block your snake eat      |
|  blinking aqua block   |           increase the eating range of your snake            |
|  blinking olive block  | upgrade the speed of your snake (upper limit is triple of the initial speed) |

Snakes will vanish whenever their head crash into someone's body (including yourself's).

(You can regard the static player as a mine.)

**Hint:**

We spotted singularity effect when we were testing the game, and it is very fascinating.
